        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Florence Nightingale was born on May 12, 1820, in Florence, Italy to Frances Nightingale and William Shore Nightingale. 
        She was the younger of two children. Nightingale’s affluent British family belonged to elite social circles. 
        Her mother, Frances, hailed from a family of merchants and took pride in socializing with people of prominent social standing. 
        Despite her mother’s interest in social climbing, Florence herself was reportedly awkward in social situations. 
        She preferred to avoid being the center of attention whenever possible. 
        Strong-willed, Florence often butted heads with her mother, whom she viewed as overly controlling. 
        Still, like many daughters, she was eager to please her mother. 
        “I think I am got something more good-natured and complying,” Florence wrote in her own defense, 
        concerning the mother-daughter relationship.</p>

        <h3>Nursing</h3>
        <p>In the early 1850s, Nightingale returned to London, where she took a nursing job in a Middlesex hospital for ailing governesses. 
            Her performance there so impressed her employer that Nightingale was promoted to the superintendent within just a year 
            of being hired. The position proved challenging as Nightingale grappled with a cholera outbreak and unsanitary conditions 
            conducive to the rapid spread of the disease. Nightingale made it her mission to improve hygiene practices, significantly 
            lowering the death rate at the hospital in the process. The hard work took a toll on her health. She had just barely 
            recovered when the biggest challenge of her nursing career presented itself. </p>

        <h3>The Crimean War</h3>
        <p>In October of 1853, the Crimean War broke out. The British Empire was at war against the Russian Empire for control of the Ottoman Empire. 
            Thousands of British soldiers were sent to the Black Sea, where supplies quickly dwindled. 
            By 1854, no fewer than 18,000 soldiers had been admitted into military hospitals.
            At the time, there were no female nurses stationed at hospitals in Crimea. 
            The poor reputation of past female nurses had led the war office to avoid hiring more. 
            But, after the Battle of Alma, England was in an uproar about the neglect of their ill and injured soldiers, 
            who not only lacked sufficient medical attention due to hospitals being horribly understaffed but also languished 
            in appallingly unsanitary and inhumane conditions.
            In late 1854, Nightingale received a letter from Secretary of War Sidney Herbert, asking her to organize a corps 
            of nurses to tend to the sick and fallen soldiers in the Crimea. Nightingale rose to her calling. She quickly assembled 
            a team of 34 nurses from a variety of religious orders and sailed with them to the Crimea just a few days later.
            Although they had been warned of the horrid conditions there, nothing could have prepared Nightingale and her 
            nurses for what they saw when they arrived at Scutari, the British base hospital in Constantinople. 
            The hospital sat on top of a large cesspool, which contaminated the water and the hospital building itself. 
            Patients lay on in their own excrement on stretchers strewn throughout the hallways. Rodents and bugs scurried past them. 
            The most basic supplies, such as bandages and soap, grew increasingly scarce as the number of ill and wounded steadily increased.
             Even water needed to be rationed. More soldiers were dying from infectious diseases like typhoid and cholera 
             than from injuries incurred in battle. </p>
