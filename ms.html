        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Young Mary was born in Kingston on the Caribbean island of Jamaica, some time in 1805.  
            No one is sure of the exact date – she kept that a secret - but it is believed to be the 23rd November. 
            Her father was a Scottish soldier stationed on the island – at that time, Jamaica was part of the British Empire – 
            and her mother was a Jamaican nurse and healer. She had a sister called Louisa and a brother called Edward.
             We don’t know if Mary went to school, but we do know that from a very young age she had an interest in medicine and nursing. 
             When she was just 12, she was helping her mother run a boarding house in Kingston, 
             where many of the guests were sick or injured soldiers. 
             Her mother taught her a lot about traditional Jamaican treatments and remedies, and she also learned 
             a lot from army doctors staying at the boarding house.</p>

        <h3>Nursing</h3>
        <p>If there was one thing Mary loved, it was travel! At that time, it wasn’t common for women to travel a lot… 
            but Mary sure did. In fact, when she was a teenager, she took two trips to England, 
            where she spent three years in total. She was quite the business woman, too, and later journeyed to the 
            islands of Bahamas, Haiti and Cuba, where she bought spices, pickles and jams to sell back in Jamaica. In 1836, Mary married an English 
            man called Edwin Seacole in her hometown of Kingston. But sadly, Edwin was a very sick man and and died just a few years later, 
            in 1844. Following her husband’s death, Mary focussed on caring for sick people.
            In 1850, her medical skills were very much needed, when many people in Kingston 
            fell victim to a deadly disease called cholera. </p>

        <h3>The Crimean War</h3>
        <p>Mary returned to Kingston in 1853, but she didn’t stay long. On hearing news of British soldiers going off 
            to Russia to fight in the bloody battles of the Crimean War, she wanted to help. 
            And so… off she went to the the War Office in London to requesting to join Florence Nightingale and her team of nurses 
            treating wounded and sick soldiers in the Crimea! Sadly, Mary was turned down, along with several other nurses. 
            But was that enough to stop the Mary? No way! Together with her friend Thomas Day, 
            in 1855 she set off to the Crimea in a ship stocked with medical supplies. </p>
